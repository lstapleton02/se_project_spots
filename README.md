# Project 3: Spots

This project creates a gallery of posts, an avatar and profile.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images
- Deployment

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This webpage is responsive and allows users to post images.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**Deployment**

This webpage is deployed to GitHub Pages
